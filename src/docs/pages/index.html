<p>Front Street is a front-end framework I (<a href="https://jasonbobich.com"  title="WordPress Web Developer" target="_blank">Jason</a>) have been working on for awhile. The ultimate goal here is to completely replace the use of Bootstrap in my biggest commercial WordPress product, <a href="https://wpjumpstart.com" title="WordPress Theme Framework" target="_blank">Jump Start</a>.</p>

<p>Although I haven't written this "About" section of the docs quite yet, feel free to search and browse the Core, Utilities, and Blocks sections over in the navigation to the left.</p>
