# Front Street

Front Street is a front-end framework I've been working on for awhile. The ultimate goal here is to completely replace the use of Bootstrap in my biggest commercial WordPress product, [Jump Start](https://wpjumpstart.com).

Eventually, after some of the dust settles around the upcoming release of WordPress 5 and the new editor (codename [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg), I'd like to get going on seeing this implemented into Jump Start. If not for Gutenberg, this would have happened already.

Although a lot of the JavaScript I wrote last year here could use some modernizing, this framework is actually surprisingly complete, at this point. I'm even using it pretty practically in another one of my projects, [Back Road](https://github.com/themeblvd/backroad).

You can view a live demo of all the parts of Front Street at [frontstreet.io](https://frontstreet.io), which just serves the "docs" folder here, via Github pages.

I plan to re-write all the JavaScript here in Front Street and inevitably incorporate it into a future Jump Start 3.0.
