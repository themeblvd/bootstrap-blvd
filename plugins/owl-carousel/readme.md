# Owl Carousel Inclusion

## JavaScript

To lighten things up, we've compiled a custom owl-carousel.js file to
go with Front Street. Below is a list of all plugins that come with
Owl Carousel by default. We've left out the LazyLoad and Video plugins
in our custom-compiled version.

* owl.carousel.js - yes
* owl.autorefresh.js - yes
* ~~owl.lazyload.js~~ - no
* owl.autoheight.js - yes
* ~~owl.video.js~~ - no
* owl.animate.js - yes
* owl.autoplay.js - yes
* owl.navigation.js - yes
* ~~owl.hash.js~~ - no
* owl.support.js - yes

## CSS

In our package we've included only the .scss files from Owl Carousel that
we're using. We've @import'ing these into Front Street's sliders.scss file.

* core - yes
* animate - yes
* autoheight - yes
* ~~lazyload~~ - no
* ~~video~~ - no
