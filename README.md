## Getting Started

There are two basic ways to include Front Street in your project.

1. Include Front Street core only, for a lightweight base framework to build on.
2. Include the full Front Street framework, including core styles and all blocks.

### Core Styles Only

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/themeblvd/frontstreet/releases/latest) with pre-built assets.
2. Copy `/dist/css/frontstreet-core.min.css` to your project and include it within the `<head>` of your website.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/file/frontstreet-core.min.css" />
```

### Full Framework

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/themeblvd/frontstreet/releases/latest) with pre-built assets.
2. Copy `/dist/css/frontstreet.min.css` to your project and include it within the `<head>` of your website.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/file/frontstreet.min.css" />
```

3. Copy `/dist/css/frontstreet.min.js` to your project and include at the bottom of your website before the closing `</body>` tag.

<script src="/path/to/file/frontstreet.min.js"></script>
```
