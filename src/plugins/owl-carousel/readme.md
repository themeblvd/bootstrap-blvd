## How to Include

Front Street takes care of all the styling for Owl Carousel, which is an extension of the SCSS files included from Owl Carousel, here in this directory.

So, to utilize Owl Carousel and the "slider" block of Front Street, you just need to include the Owl Carousel script. And from there, Front Street also takes care of implementing custom scripts to get Owl Carousel binded and running.

## CSS

In our package we've included only the SCSS files from Owl Carousel that we're using, which Front Street implements and then extends.

* `core.scss`
* `animate.scss`
* `autoheight.scss`
